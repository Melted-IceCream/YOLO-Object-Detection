# YOLOv11n Object Detection Training

This is a simple training of the YOLO neural network on a custom dataset for object detection. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/enddl22/deepnir-11fruits).

# Usage
1. Create a python virtual environment and clone the repository.
   ```
   python -m venv YOLO
   ```
   ```
   cd YOLO
   ```
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Melted-IceCream/YOLO-Object-Detection.git
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment and install dependencies.
   ```
   Scripts\activate
   ```
   ```
   pip install ultralytics notebook
   ```
3. Open Jupyter notebook.
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Run all cells. (The training may take some time to complete.)
